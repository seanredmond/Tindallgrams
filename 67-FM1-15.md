Ever since I've been involved with these spacecraft computer programs
there has been an awful lot of flak regarding the program interlocks.
Specifically, in the AS-204 program, there is a "Verb 37 Table" which
prohibits the astronaut from calling up certain programs out of sequence.
Constraints of this nature have been labeled intolerable, not only by
the flight crew but by many other influential people. As a result of
this, and partly due to the greatly increased complexity of the AS-258
programs, MIT has decided to include _no interlocks_ whatsoever in them.
Therefore, in the future it will be the crew's responsibility to see to
it that they don't call programs in an improper sequence. The result
of doing so may be as trivial as getting a bunch of garbage for answers,
or in some cases could scramble the programs to the extent that it is
necessary to initiate the sequence over again - perhaps at the cost of a
considerable amount of time and effort. Apparently, there is no known
circumstance whereby improper crew inputs could foul up the programs
irrecoverably.

Since crew procedure will take the place of the "Verb 37 Table" in the
AS-258 programs, MIT has prepared a preliminary program-matrix defining
the sequences it is necessary to follow as their crew moves from one program
to another. Copies of this preliminary matrix are available from
Rick Nobles and Paul Stuff for use in the development of crew procedures.

I am sure this will make all you interlock critics happy.
