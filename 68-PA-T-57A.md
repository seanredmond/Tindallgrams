1.  The Midcourse Phase Data Priority meeting of March 6 was devoted to
the earth orbital phase evaluation of guidance systems to make the translunar
injection (TLI) Go/No Go decision.  It was reported at the outset
that a new set of ground rules have been established with regard to this
subject.  They are:

    (a)  A TLI maneuver will not be attempted if there is any indication
that the S-IVB IU guidance system is not working properly.

    (b)  A properly operating CSM PNGCS is not mandatory for TLI.  That
is, it is acceptable to make a TLI maneuver with a failed CSM PNGCS if
the subsequent alternate mission is considered more valuable than remaining
in earth orbit.

Rationale for these ground rules is given in Memorandum No. 68-PA-T-56A
(H. W. Tindall), dated March 7, 1968.  The manner in which we may detect
S-IVB IU failure is also presented in that memo and is partially reproduced
in this one to make the rest of it more understandable.

2.  There are two sources of S-IVB IU failure indication.  The first is by
the S-IVB's own failure detection system which indicates failures via
telemtry.  The second is by comparison with the CSM PNGCS and MSFN tracking.
These comparisons, it must be emphasized, are extremely gross.  That
is, the S-iVB IU is designed to be at least an order of magnitude more
precise than the CSM PNGCS and the MSFN.  Thus, these monitoring systems---
telemetry, CSM and MSFN---do not prodive data to prove that the IU is
performing normally but rather are only able to show us when it has
degraded very badly---for example, 30 to 100 sigma! Whereas, MBFC's
definition of a definitely and absolutely broken IU is anything beyond
3 sigma.  Therefore, the actual limits we would select for TLI Go/No Go
based on the S-IVB IU performance evaluation can only be the smallest,
dependably, detectable failure.  That is, we would use the smallest
failure which we can confidently attribute to the S-IVB rather than the
comparison system itself.  Deviations in excess of that amount are
certainly true S-IVB IU failures and would result in a No Go for TLI.

3.  At this meeting we added another ground rule regarding guidance systems
checks prior to TLI.  The question was whether or not the sextant and scanning
telescope are mandatory for TLI Go/No Go.  If they were it would be neccessary
for the crew to check them out.  However, analysis performed by MPAD has shown
that LM PNGCS alignment with the AOT and undocked COAS alignment of the PNGCS
and SCS can be accomplished with sufficient accuracy to ensure safe return to
earth after TLI.  Accordingly, as of this time we are proceding under the
assumption that checkout of the sextant and telecope need not be performed
prior to TLI.  If you do not agree with this decision, you should say so
immediately.
                        
4.  By accepting these ground rules, neither a platform alignment nor sextant
check need be ???????? in the ?????????.  Therefore, it should be possible
to establish a monitoring technique which would permit performing TLI on
the first opportunity even for an Atlantic injection (i.e., about 100 minutes
after lift off).  The technique would be to compare the CSM PNGCS and the
S-IVB IU during the launch phase and perhaps in earth parking orbit.  If
this comparison is favorable, it can be assumed that both the S-IVB IU and
the CSM PNGCS are performing well and we would execute TLI.  If the comparison
were not within those limits, one of the systems must have failed by our
definition, but we may have insufficient knowledge to determine which one
without performing a CSM PNGCS platform alignment in earth orbit.  This would
probably require going another revolution and, thus, TLI could not occur until
the second opportunity.  If the failure turns out to be in the IU, we would
not perform TLI.
			  
5.  The Guidance and Performance Branch outlined their proposal for processing
and displaying launch phase telemetry in the control center to evaluate S-IVB
and spacecraft guidance systems performance as the prime TLI Go/No Go data
source.  They recommend plotting differences in the three components of
velocity as determined from the PNCGS and S-IVB IU state vectors.  These
would be plotted in real time on strip chart recorders in the Mission Control
Center.  It is felt they would be extremely effective in not only detecting
system failures but also for isolating exactly what type of failure has
occurred.  Limits would be established on three differences based on accuracy
of the CSM PNCGS in accordance with the philosophy noted in paragraph 2.
There is one big source of "error" in these plots resulting from our inability
to align the CSM PNGCS accurately in azimuth on the launch pad.  We had a
similar problem, you recall, on Gemini and our solution here is about the
same.  It is proposed that a simple computation be performed similar to the
platform alignment update carried out in the Gemini program at 100 seconds
after lift off.  This computation was based on the assumption that any
difference in the horizontal velocity vectors detected when comparing the
spacecraft to the S-IVB is due to gyro compassing misalignment of the spacecraft
IMU on the launch pad.  It is a simple way of determining what this
misalignment is in order to improve the comparison by mathematically accounting
for it in the plots during the remainder of the launch phase.  In addition, it
makes the magnitude of the misalignment available for use in later guidance
systems pergormance evaluation tests inflight.

6.  Flight Control Division and MPAD are jointly engaged in perparing RTCC
program requirements based on this technique including display format and
equation formulation.  These program requirements should be in a form
suitable for transmittal to FCD within 2 weeks, and negotiating will then
begin to determine whether or not they can be included in the earlier
manned Saturn 5 launches.  They would be desirable on the "D" mission,
possible mandatory for the "E", and certainly mandatory for the "F" and "G".

7.  We next discussed the question of whether or not the launch phase systems
evaluation for first opportunity TLI Go/No Go described above is sufficient
all by itself.  That is, platform drift checks based on telemetry gimbal
angles from the SIV-B IU and the spacecraft PNGCS have been proposed as a
supplement to the launch phase comparison, but there are obvious problems
associated with that procedure which may make it rather useless---although
I'm sure they will be monitored grossly.  For example, the data is not
time synchronized nor even homogeneous.  As a result, it would be necessary
for the spacecraft to maintain minute attitude rates over the measurement
period which is almost impossible to achieve.  Furthermore, structural
bending and thermal warping also create very large errors---comparable to
the differences we're looking for.  MPAD was given the action item of
determining if such a test contributes significantly to our confidence
for TLI since if it doesn't we can simplify things a greal deal by
eliminating the whole procedure.

8. Finally, we investigate how we would determine which system had failed
if the launch evaluation shown disagreement.  It appears necessary to perform
a platform alignment, or at least a determination of its orientation.  This
would probably force delay of TLI until the second opportunity.  We are
currently investigating the following approach:

    (a)  Evaluate the CSM platform torquing angles.  The x and y axis should
be near zero and the z axis should equal the pad misalignment as detected
in the launch phase.  If not within limits it has failed.

    (b)  Using MSFN tracking for orbit determination, compare the actual
trajectory against the S-IVB IU insertion state vector trajectory.  This
requires 1Â½ revolutions on tracking.  Disagreement beyond limits indicates
S-IVB IU failure.

9.  Obviously, we have a lot to do.  But if the ground rules are accepted
it is mostly a matter of implementing a technique we understang.  Believe
it or not, I think we've got this TLI thing pretty nearly licked.  I hope so!
