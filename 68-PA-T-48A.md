1.  In the absence of Charley Parker, our beloved leader, I inherited
the job of chairing this meeting which probably accounts for why we
didn't really get an awful lot done. However, there are a couple of
things that are probably worth reporting.

2.  We discussed the imprtance of the "stage verify" discrete to the
spacecraft computer.  Apparently, its sole purpose is to initialize the
DAP such that it may perform properly.  For example, it stops sending
steering commands to the DPS trim gimbals.  It also changes the spacecraft
mass used in DAP operations from the ascent stage, plus whatever
remains of the descent stage, to ascent mass only.  Based on this
information it computes jet firing duration for attitude control
differently, of course.  I had been concerned that failure to get this
signal during Ascent would cause poor attitude control and we are
initiating a program change request to back up "stage verify" with the
"lunar surface flag" since whenever that event occurs use of the ascent
stage only is a certainty.  Jack Craven (FCD) pointed out that due to
the design of the system the much more probable failure is to get a
"stage verify" signal prematurely.  If that happened, when we are still
operating on the DPS, it would stop DPS steering and would make the RCS
attitude control extemely sluggish.  __That__ would be bad news!  All that
is required to do this is for either of two relays to inadvertantly
open.

3.  As you know, we are planning to devote a short period of time
immediately after landing on the lunar surface to checkout of critical
systems.  This would be done both onboard and in the MCC leading to a
GO/NO GO for one CSM revolution (about 2 hours).  This is exactly the
same sort of thing as the GO/NO GO for one revolution following earth
launch.  Jack Craven accepted the action item, which I had previously
discussed with Gene Kranz, to establish how long it should take to do
this system check in order that we may make all other mission planning
and screw procedures consistent.  It is expected to be in the order of
3 minutes, unless it takes a long time to really detect and APS pressure
leak.  Until the GO/NO GO we intend to remain in a state from which we
can instantly "abort stage" and go.  After that it will take much
longer.

4.  Almost all the rest of our discussion dealt with what the command
module should be doing during and immediately following LM ascent from
the lunar surface.  One unresolved question was whether or not the
command module should attempt to observe the LM ascent with the sextant.
It was not clear what purpose would be served other than more rapid
aquisition for rendezvous navigation tracking after insertion.  It
seemed to us the most important thing, of course, was for the command
module to take whatever steps are neccessary to assure getting a good
LM state vector in its computer for rendezvous maneuver targetting as
soon as possible.  It seems almost certain that we should load the
nomonal LM insertion state vector int the CMC from the ground prior to
LM ascent to guard against subsequent communication breakdown.  It
was also agreed that we should probablt prepare the MCC to automatically
take the LM post-insertion state vector from the LM telemetry and transmit
it back to the command module.  Whether we would actually do this
or not depends on whether we lose more by forcing the command module to
stay in the Uplink Command program (P-27) thereby preventing rendezvous
tracking and onboard navigation for a substantial period of time.  That
is, analysis may show yjay with good VHF ranging and/or sextant tracking
the command module may be able to converge on an acceptable LM state
vector better without this ground participation, if it gets going more
quickly.

5.  I guess I am attacking the old "MIT me" in stating that we are
seriously handicapped by having no reliable definition of the Luminary
lunar surface and ascent programs (e.g. GSOP Chapters 4 and 5).  I
understand review copies of these should be available within 3 to 6
weeks and I am sure nothing more can be done to speed them up.  We'll eat'em
raw when they get here!
