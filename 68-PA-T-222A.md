Neil Townsend (EP2) informed me by phone - and will supply written
confirmation - that the minimum duration SPS burn for C' should be
no less than 0.5 seconds.  We had been assuming something smaller.
According to MPAD (Otis Graf, FM7) this makes the crossover point
between use of the RCS versus the SPS engine:

Translunar midcourse correction - 5 fps

Transearth midcourse correction - 12 fps

These values will be explained completely in an FM7 memo soon to be
distributed.  I just want everybody to be aware of the new values and
to start using them in his planning.
