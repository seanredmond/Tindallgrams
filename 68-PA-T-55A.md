---
1.  On March 4 we had the first "E" Mission Rendezvous Mission Techniques
meeting.  It was devoted almost exclusively to understanding what the
mission requirements and mission plans are for this phase of the flight.
The discussion raised a few questions and some action items were assigned
to get them answered.

2.  It is evident that activities prior to the rendezvous such as the big
S-IVB maneuver simulating translunar injection (TLI) will substantially
perturb conditions at the start of the rendezvous unless compensation is
provided.  This, of course, means that the logic and capability to plan
this "compensation" in real time must be designed and implemented.
Ed Lineberry and his people were asked to look into this. (They're doing
a similar job for Mission "D" already.)

3.  The "E" mission is typical of any involving LM operations.  It starts
with an undocking and visual inspection.  This is followed by a small RCS
maneuver by one vehicle or the other to provide a controlled mini-distance
separation trajectory to avoid costly station keeping.  This is followed
in turn by a larger separation maneuver which kicks off whatever is to be
done.  In this case, the larger separation maneuver, called a "Phasing
maneuver", places the LM ahead and above the command module properly
located to execute the CDH coelliptic maneuver about 2 hours and 40 minutes
later.  It is intended that these Phasing and CDH maneuvers will be
computed in real time in the RTCC utilizing the so-called NCC/NSR rendezvous
maneuver logic developed for Gemimi.  This targeting will force the CDH
maneuver to occur at spacecraft apogee over Hawaii, with the proper
differential altitude and phase angle.

4.  The entire rendezvous will be carried out with a single inertial
platform orientation (REFSMMAT) for each spacecraft.  They will be
computed and relayed to the spacecraft from the ground.  Of course, more
than one platform alignment will be performed.  The point is they will
all be carried out to achieve the same inertial platform orientation.
Furthermore, it is anticipated that the REFSMMAT on Mission "E" will be
selected essentially the same as for the "D" and "G" missions.  That is,
they will be tied to TPI and will provide an FDAI 8-ball display of
0, O, 0 when the spacecraft is aligned in-plane, horizontal, wings level,
heads up.


5.  It was agreed that an undocked platform alignment would be made between
the separation and Phasing maneuvers.  In order to permit this we established
that separation will occur 5 minutes before the start of the darkness period
prior to the Phasing maneuver.  Since this will result in almost a complete
revolution between the separation and Phasing maneuvers a small radial
separation burn such as planned for missions "D" and "G" may now work out
too well here, and the Rendezvous Analysis Branch was given the action item
of selecting an optimum separation burn to be illustrated at the next meeting
with the standard relative motion plot.  Flight Planning was requested to
work out the crew timeline in detail for the period between undocking and
the Phasing manneuver.  We want to make sure that the various crew activities
asocciated with LM checkout and trajectory control do not conflict nor are
unduly crowded.  I'm sure someone will also be interested in determining
the consumables required during this period since apparently both electric
power and RCS propellant are at a premium.

6.  Finally, the crew procedures people were requested to evaluate and
report at the next meeting the preferred lighting conditions for the TPI
maneuver when it is executed by a spacecraft approaching from ahead and
above.  This will be the situation for the first TPI opportunity on the
"E" mission.  Although that maneuver would not actually be executed as long
as everything is still going along okay, we should be prepared to do it if 
we have to.  And the preferred lighting conditions influence scheduling of
the Phasing maneuver itself.


7.  The current rendezvous plan provides two opportunities to perform a
CSI maneuver, both of which are nominally zero. However, it was questioned
as to whether the first opportunity really exists since it occurs only 36
minutes after the Phasing maneuver with insufficient ground tracking and
communications to support it.  It may be desirable for the crew to perform
rendezvous navigation and target this maneuver; the question is whether
they would ever really execute it. The point is, if it turns out to be
small there seems to be no disadvantage in delaying until the nexc CSI
opportunity one revolution later, and if the onboard systems indicate that
a large CSI maneuver is needed there is reason to suspect some system
malfunction.  This is based on the assumption there had been no indication
of non-nominal performance during the Phasing burn, which implies that CSI
should be near zero.  It seems we ought to obtain some MSFN confirmation
before making a big burn that might screw up the situation.  In conjunction
with all this, the Rendezvous Analysis Branch was given the action item of
determining parametrically theeffects of residuals in the Phasing maneuver
in terms of CSI maneuver magnitude and other trajectory dispersions such
as TPI time slippage.


8.  It has been stated that a primary mission objective on this flight is
to perform a comprehensive AGS systems test.  This, of course, must involve
rendezvous navigation and targeting as well as maneuver guidance and control.
This can be done in a number of ways.  For example, the AGS could be allowed
to operate continuously without PNGCS update throughout the entire rendezvous
exercise.  Or the test could be broken down into a number of individual tests
with re-initialization ]provided periodically. It is also nececcaart to specify
when and under what conditions radar data should be input into the AGS.  G&C
Division was requested to amplify their mission requirement by providing a
more detailed description of exactly what they would like accomplished and 
if possible how they would like to do it.

9. That is about all we covered during this short meeting.  Once nice thing
apparent was the substantial carryover from the "C" and "D" mission techniques
meetings which should permit us to complete work on "E" in a considerably 
shorter period than would otherwise be the case. it was agreed that Monday
afternoon is a good meeting time and so, if possible, we intend to get
together every other week at that time.  The next meeting is scheduled
at 1:00 p.m., March 18, in Building 4, Room 396.  That's 1300 for you,
Frank.
