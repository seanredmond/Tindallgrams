In order to help solidify requirements for the AAP CSM computer program we are
having a Mission Techniques type meeting on Tuesday, January 27 at 9 a.m., in
Room 378 of Building 4. The specific subject to be discussed is the rendezvous
phase of the AAP mission. The thing we are particularly anxious to pin down is
the type of maneuver sequence we feel should be utilized, since that will define
onboard programs required. It will also probably help clarify other aspects of
mission planning such as crew procedures and onboard charts, trajectory and
attitude profiles and even some hardware requirements such as the flashing
beacon and VHF specification. A basic assumption, which I believe has been
accepted without argument, is that a completely onboard capability for
performing the rendezvous should be implemented since the ground support may be
marginal. In fact, as a spin-off from this meeting, just how well the ground
should be able to help with the rendezvous may become better understood.

This is a working session and attendance should be limited to people directly
concerned with this subject.
