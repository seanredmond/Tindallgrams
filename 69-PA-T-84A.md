subject: G Rendezvous Navigation OJT is proposed

CMP Mike COllins called the other day to ask if there is any reason
why he should not do active rendezvous navigation between DIO and PDI
on the G mission. That is, he would like to run PDO incorporating
sextant and VHF ranging data to update the LM state vector in the
CMC. His primary purpose is to get some on-the-job training (OJT)
before he has to do it for real during the upcoming rendezvous. You
recall, this was in the F Flight Plan and I assume John Young did
it, although I'm not sure. I told him that I knew of no reason why
he shouldn't and I have asked several other experts who agree. I
also suggested to Mike that he contact John personally to get any
pertinent F mission feedback.

This memo is to inform you that this activity will be included in
the G mission timeline unless somebody comes up with a valid
objection. Do you have one?
