This note is to help insure that the word gets around regarding reduced
command module reentry L/D. MIT has heard rumors that the L/D may be
reduced to a value of .25 and emphasized during our program development
plan meeting that they are fairly certain the present spacecraft computer
program formulation will not handle that. The current formulation
is designed to handle a minimum L/D value of .30 and, although they do
not know how far this limit can be extended, they feel certain major
rework will be required for .25. This is no a new discovery. Our
reentry experts in MPAD have been saying the same thing for some time.
