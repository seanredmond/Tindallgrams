In spite of the feverish activity we have on three swinging missions
C, C', and D, a few of us found a couple of minutes to spend on the
G Rendezvous.  Some things came out of it that are probably worth
reporting:

1\.  As you know, on the D mission during a LM active rendezvous
the command module will be targeted with mirror image maneuvers to
backup the LM for CSI and CDH.  These mirror image maneuvers are
identical in magnitude but opposite in direction, since it has been
found that the small errors resulting are a reasonable price for the
simplicity we obtain in the operation.  Unfortunately, when operating
around the moon it's apparently not possible to use identical  ΔV
components for CSM mirror image targeting.  This means that it will
probably be necessary for the crew to first cycle through the CSI/CDH
targeting program for the other spacecraft (P7O series programs) and
then run through the targeting for their own spacecraft (P30 series
programs).

2\.  For the D mission it was decided that a single TPI elevation
angle could be adopted (27.5°) for all rendezvous situations.  That is,
either spacecraft coming in from either above or below.  Unfortunately,
the lunar rendezvous geometry prevents us from adopting this operational
simplification and we must use different values of elevation angle depending
on whether the approach is from above or below.  The values we have
selected (based on Jerry Bell's work) are 26.6° for the approach from
below and 28.3° for the approach from above.  The basic difference between
these values is the phase angle between the two vehicles at TPI, which in
lunar orbit is much greater than around the earth for the same separation
distance.  The primary reason for having to use different values is to
keep the TPI maneuver along the line-of-sight.  Another reason is to keep
component maneuver execution time for the two vehicles the same except
for differences in their navigation.

If you have any comments or questions about any of this, our next get
together on the lunar rendezvous is currently scheduled for 9 a.m. on
September 18, 1968.
