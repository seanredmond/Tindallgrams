1.  Except for the first item listed below, the entire "C" Mission Rendezvous
Mission Techqniques meeting of March 8 was devoted to the terminal phase.
Based on the very great importance FCOD is putting on proper lighting during
the braking phase, a proposal is being considered for including another little
tune up maneuver between NSR and TPI.  I mention this here to make sure you
don't overlook it since it is a rather significant item.

2.  Considerable attention is being given by those responsible to lengthening
the "C" mission launch window.  Apparently, the constrains for the beginning
and end of this window are almost solely associated with lighting, and MPAD
is in the process of compiling all of these constraints on a single plot.
It will probably be used as a basis of determining nominal lift off time and
launch window duration as a function of launch date.  One constraint, which
should be included, is of particular interest to our "C" Mission Rendezvous
Mission Techniques Panel.  Namely, a perioid of darkness is mandatory between
the NCC2 and the NSR maneuver in order to provide an opportunity to fine
align the spacecraft platform in preparation for the sextant rendezvous
navigation and actual execution of the terminal phase.  Specifically, darkness
must be available during the period from NCC2 plus 5 minutes until NCC2 plus
20 minutes.  Of course, if in real time conditions prevent making this platform
alignment the rendezvous would not neccessarily be abandoned.  The point is this
constraint should be considered mandatory for launch but not mandatory for
rendezvous.  This constraint has been relayed to the MPAD mission engineer.

3.  Now, on to the terminal phase.  Our first discussion dealt with the use
of the TPI crew charts.  It is FCSD's desire to prepare and utilize TPI charts
on the "C" mission rendezvous in very much the same was as they were used on
Gemini.  That is, they will develop procedures for the crew to obtain an
onboard soultion for TPI based on both the charts and closed loop PNGCS results.
It is this integrated solution which would be compared to the MSFN for
determining whether the onboard or ground solution should be utilized for TPI.
The exact procedure for all of this will be the subject of further meetings.
An important point to be made, however, is that onboard TPI charts do play a
part in the "C" mission.  This was questioned since apparently on the "D"
rendezvous, there is some indication no TPI charts will be used in the command
module since the one-man crew is too busy with Sundisk to work them.

4.  As you know, it is intended that the TPI solutions always be based on a
particular elevation angle of the target vehicle with respect to the local
horizontal.  The value to be used now and forever more on the "C" mission
shall be 27.45°.  The onboard charts have been developed in accordance with
this and it is FCSD's desire that all future rederence trajectories, mission
planning, etc., use this same value.  All other organizations have agreed to
go along with this, however, Ed Lineberry's people (OMAB) are emphasizing
the fact that using this value of elevation angle will nominally result in a
situation where the TPI thrust vector will not be along the line of sight to
the target.  It is expected to deviate by about 6° from that alignment and
everyone should clearly understand that at this time.  Furthermore, some
consideration has been given to actually modifying the value of elevation
angle to be used in real time as noted in last week's minutes.  It has been
reported that on adjustment in the elevation angle in the order of ½°, to
be determined at the beginning of the rendezvous exercise, would ensure that
the thrust vector for TPI would have been along the line of sight. However,
FCSD maintains this would foul up the charts and that they were more anxious
to avoid that than to maintain that particular thrust alignment during the
mission.  Accordingly, no further consideration will be given to changing the
elevation angle from 27.45°, either in advance of the mission or during it
with the single, possible exception discussed next.


5.  In response to last week's action item, FCSD reported that lighting
conditions during braking have a higher priority than sticking to the 27.45°
TPI elevation angle.  The important point to be made here is that trajectory
dispersions could cause the TPI time, based on the 27.45° elevation angle, to
slip to such an extent that lighting at braking would be unsatisfactory.
There are apparently two alternatives which can be considered to avoid ?
from occuring.  One is a real time adjustment in the TPI elevation angle if
it becomes apparent that the TPI maneuver has slipped beyond acceptable limits
and the other is a new proposal by Ed Lineberry that a small adjustment
maneuver be made between NSR and TPI to return conditions to nominal at both
TPI and braking.  The rest of this memorandum is devoted to these two
alternatives.

      (a)  Alternate One.  Immediately after the NSR maneuver the crew takes
????? ?? sextant observations of the S-IVB to update its state vector, and
then calls up the TPI targeting program (P-34) to obtain the TPI time. It
is anticipated that this onboard solution for TPI time based on when the CSM
will arrive at the position giving the desired elevation angle should be
quite accurate.  That is, all previous computations were based on ground
determined state vectors which have a relatively large error in determination
of TPI time.  The onboard determination using sextant observations should be
an order of magnitude more accurate.  Accordingly,  at this time in the 
operation we would have our first accurate indication of TPI time. The crew
????????????? ???? TPI time with the ground relayed ???????? of ???????
??????????????????????????? slipped excessively such ???? lighting
??????????????????????????????? acceptable.  In the event the slip is
excessive the crew  would terminate and recall P-34 utilizing the "time
option" to determine the elevation angle consistant with an acceptable
TPI time.  Since it is neccessary to utilize the "elevation angle option"
in P-34 to permit a comparison of the onboard and ground solutions, the
crew would have to terminate and recall P-34 using the elvation angle
just determined as input.  They would also have to relay the value of
elevation angle to the ground for their computations.  Obviously, the
thrusting would not be along the line of sight for would TPI occur at
27.45°, but proper lighting conditions at braking would be assured.

      (b)  Alternate Two starts out the same way as One.  That is, the
crew updates the S-IVB state vector using the rendezvous navigation
system and determines the TPI time and its slippage.  Then, using this
value of slippage they should be able to make a simple computation to
determine a maneuver to adjust the TPI back to nominal time while
retaining the nominal elevation angle.  This maneuver would be horizontal
and inplane to be made 30 seconds after NSR, probably using the Average G 
program (P-4?).  The Orbital Mission Analysis Branch (formerly Rendezvous
Analysis Branch) was given the action item of determining the computational
technique or chart giving maneuver magnitude vs. desired change in TPI time.
Since it is expected to be in the order of 1/3 fps for each minute TPI time
change desired, and since we are talking about TPI time adjustments less
than 15 minutes, the maneuver should be less than 5 fps.  FCSD was asked
to work out a detailed timeline which includes this maneuver to see if it
presents any problems.  One thing we are particularly interested is in
whether it should be done as a standard procedure regardless of whether
TPI time slippage was acceptable or not, or if it should only be done if
some limit has been exceeded.  Assuming the procedure is not too complex,
my personal preference would be to make it a standard procedure.  Phil
Shaffer expects to spend some time next week with the "C" crew at the
Florida AMB and will discuss this with them at that time.

6.  Consideration has been given to having the crew call up the TPI
targetting program (P-34) immediately after NSR in order to dertmine TPI
time in order to set the spacecraft clocks.  Currently the concensus is
that this is not a useful operation and it should be dropped from the
timeline.

7.  As you can see, we are really getting into the fine detail on the "C"
rendezvous and I predict that if we spend the next two or three sessions
going through the mission techniques flow charts, we will be ready to call
in the rest of the world and we could then ice this whole thing down within
the next couple of months.  Right now I expect the next meeting will be
devoted to the review of the flow charts.
