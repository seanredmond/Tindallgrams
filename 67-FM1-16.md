In thinking about it a little more, I guess I should have pointed out
in the last of these little notes that I'm assuming if we use the horizon
scanners, we will go ahead and torque the platform at orbit rate.
This, of course, will require a certain amount of modification in some
of the spacecraft computer programs but should not present an overwhelming
problem. In fact, I have informally ask Norm Sears to look
through his lists and let us know which ones would be affected. Once
we have done that I suppose we will have eliminated the problem of the
orbit rate ball, the value of which I don't believe anyone can argue
about in these earthly orbital missions.
