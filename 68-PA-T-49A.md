1. We spent just about the entire February 26 meeting discussing the way 
   the AGS and PNGCS should be used during the "D" mission rendezvous. I 
   feel as though we have accomplished quite a lot in this area having 
   reached agreement on how the AGS should be used throughout that 
   mission phase, with one minor exception. It is all based on the 
   ground rule that on this mssion the AGS should be maintained in that 
   state which makes it most useful to perform the rendezvous in the 
   event of PNGCS failure. It was noted that if after having established 
   the preferred techniques in accordance with that ground rule it is 
   possible to include some AGS systems tests without jeopardizing crew 
   safety or other mission objects, they would be considered.

2. Nominal situation: PNGCS seams to be working properly and is prime; 
   AGS must be maintained in optimum state to take over in the event the 
   PNGSCS fails. This applies to all maneuvers---CSI, CDH, TPI.

   (a). Checking of the PNGCS will be by comparison with the ground 
   computed solution *only*. That is comparisons of maneuver targeting 
   from other sources, such as the AGS, backup charts or the CSM will 
   not be made to commit to the PNGCS. The PNGCS solution will be used 
   providing it is within acceptable limits of the MSFN solution. One 
   possible exception here is that, since the CSM optics provide very 
   strong solutions to the TPI delta V components perpendicular to the 
   line of sight, comparison with them may be advantageous.

   (b). The state vectors in the AGS will be updated each time PNGCS is 
   confirmed to be acceptable. This will likely be at each time it is 
   committed to make the next maneuver using the PNGCS.

   (c). AGS alignments will be made each time the PNGCS is realigned and 
   each time the state vector in the AGS is updated from the PNGCS.

   (d). No radar data will be input into the AGS as long as the PNGCS is 
   working. In effect it is obtaining benefit of the radar via the PNGCS 
   state vector updates since the PNGCS is processing the radar data.

   (e). There is no need to prepare or learn to use backup charts for 
   CSI and/or CDH maneuvers for this mission. Terminal phase charts are 
   essential in the LM.

3. In the event of a PNGCS failure: CSI and CDH only.

   (a). For the CSI and CDH, use the AGS in almost the identical manner 
   in which the Gemini spacecraft was flown .That is, use ground 
   targeted maneuvers executed with the AGS External delta V mode.

   (b). No radar data would be input into the AGS prior to the CSI and 
   CDH.

4. By far the most extensive discussion dealt with the Terminal Phase 
   Initiation (TPI) maneuver and subsequent midcourse maneuvers in the 
   event of a PNGCS failure, but with the radar still working. This was 
   the one area still lacking agreement. It is all based on the 
   assumption that a rendezvous radar failure is obvious as opposed to 
   insidious. Clarke Hackler (GCD) and Al Nathan (GAEC) where given the 
   action item to determine if this assumption is reasonable. Our 
   alternative plans for TPI---PNGCS out, radar working---are as 
   follows:

   (a). Compare the onboard chart solution for TPI with the MSFN. If the 
   comparison is favourable, execute the chart solution and, if not, use 
   the MSFN delta V's and the maneuver execution time based on the 
   onboard solution. The maneuver would be made using the AGS external 
   delta V mode---this procedure to be amplified later in this memo. *Do 
   not input radar* data into the AGS. OR...

   (b). As soon as PNGCS failure is apparent (but not sooner than CDH) 
   start updating AGS state vectors *with rendezvous radar data inputs*. 
   Proceed using GS in place of PNGCS. That is, compare TPI solution 
   with MSFN (and maybe CSM for components perpendicular to the line of 
   sight). Use AGS solution if acceptable. If not, execute MSFN delta 
   V's using AGS External Delta V mode. The argument for inputting 
   rendezvous radar in the AGS and using its solution is that it is a 
   closed loop system which analysis shows should work well using 
   rendezvous radar and more analysis is on the way to prove it further. 
   In addition, Flight Crew is concerned that the arithmetic associated 
   with the charts makes its solution more susceptible to crew error, 
   whereas the AGS does the arithmetic for them. The arguments against 
   use of radar in the AGS for TPI is that to attempt to maintain both 
   the AGS and charts solutions is likely to create an excessive work 
   load upon the crew, particularly when considering the henderences of 
   the spacesuits and the zero g environment. Furthermore, we have 
   considerable confidence in the charts and expect that if the charts 
   and AGS (with radar) solutions differ we would be inclined to believe 
   the charts and use that solution instead of the AGS anyway.

5. The following is the most startling conclusion reached today: IF the 
   LM PNGCS is working but rendezvous radar has failed, we have a 
   serious problem with the LM since no external data will be input to 
   the spacecraft systems---PNGCS, AGS or charts. In this case, it our 
   recommendations that the *command module* execute the TPI and 
   subsequent midcourse correction maneuvers and the LM do the braking 
   maneuvers.

   (a). The command module would compare its TPI solution with the MSFN. 
   If the comparison is favorable that maneuver would be executed; if 
   not, the command module would execute the MSFN delta V's using its 
   own time of ignition.

   (b). The command module would voice relay to the LM the maneuvers it 
   has executed in order that the LM crew could update the command 
   module state vectors in the LGC using the Target Delta V program. 

6. I would like to present here the rationale for making the command 
   module active for TPI and midcourse when only the rendezvous radar 
   has failed. The justification is based on assuming ourselves the 
   capability of making a good *midcourse correction* subsequent to TPI  
   which is extremely important since with not ranging device the 
   braking maneuver is going to be very difficult for the LM to do. The 
   whole point is that only the command module is able to maintain a 
   closed loop knowledge of the situation (with its sextant) and 
   maintain an up-to-date set of state vectors in the computer to target 
   the midcourse correction maneuver. Furthermore, it is only able to do 
   this well if it makes the TPI maneuver, so that its PNGCS senses that 
   too. It should be noted that this does not use a great deal of CSM 
   RCS propellant. Nowhere near that budgeted for LM rescue. All of the 
   other maneuvers are carried out by the LM and the really large RCS 
   drinker---braking---will also be carried out by the LM. The reason 
   for that, of course, is that since the LM will be coming in from 
   below, viewing the command module against a star background, it will 
   be in a much better position to do the braking maneuver. In addition, 
   we would prefer to save CSM fuel where possible.

7. An obvious additional advantage to this is that it keeps the 
   procedure as simple as possible in this critical situation. In fact, 
   it is a standard CSM TPI for which a great deal of planning and 
   training will have been carried out. On the other hand, for the LM to 
   make these maneuvers would require a great deal of coordination and 
   communication between spacecraft crews in real time which is 
   undesirable. And, it avoids having to prepare procedures and training 
   for this special situation.

8. In was stated by FCOD that the command module pilot will be unable to 
   computer onboard chart solutions for TPI due to the press of other 
   activity and so they will not be available as a data source.

9. The manner in which the AGS can be used to execute LM chart solutions 
   is bey loading a zero magnitude maneuver into its External Delta V 
   processor which zeros the registers and permits it to be used like 
   the PNGCS Average G program (P-47). The crew would thrust 
   sequentially along each of the three body axes, probably burning the 
   largest component first. The sequential operation is necessary since 
   there is only one digital readout on the DEDA register.

10. I expect that at the next meeting we will review all this and tune 
    it up a little. We should then probably apply these techniques to 
    the earlier "pseudo-TPI" maneuver which occurs half way through the 
    exercise including special considerations associated with a TPI 
    maneuver that we do not really intend to execute
