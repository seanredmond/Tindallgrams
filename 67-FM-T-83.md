1. Here's another of my irregular updates on what's going on
in the business of spacecraft computer program development.

2. SUNDISK, the earth orbital command module program, is
essentially complete and, for all practical purposes, could
be sent to Raytheon for rope manufacture whenever anyone wants
to give the word. From all I have been able to determine, the
quality of this program is very good and, perhaps, to balance
some of the criticism of MIT, they should be commended for
this. It provides the capability of doing all the things we
specified over a year ago with numerous improvements added in
along the way. (I am certain, however, changes will be made
in it before flight; for the same sort of reasons we have remade
SUNBURST ropes twice.)

3. It is now evident that the lunar landing programs -
COLOSSUS and LUMINARY - will not be completed for quite a
long time---certainly not for LM-3 and command module 103 as
we had planned. This has forced us into the position of
having to use SUNDISK on Command Module 103 and has made it
necessary to develop an interim earth orbital program (SUNDANCE)
for use on LM-3 and LM-4.

4. At this time we are in the process of determining an
accurate program development schedule for these three programs
at MIT as well as trying to identify the major problem areas
in order to attack them on at least two fronts, namely, implementing
improvements in the way the work is done and change the
MIT organization to be compatible with them I don't want to
minimize the seriousness of this situation. We are in deep,
serious yogurt!

5. One accomplishment of significance I would like to report
is that we have recognized one way of substantially improving
program delivery by making sure MIT has a precise, approved
specification of the spacecraft computer programs required by
MSC right now. Our recent SUNDANCE and COLOSSUS GSOP review
and associated technical direction to MIT accomplished this to
a large degree. However, there was one large area lacking definition
and MSC approval, namely the change in the structure of the
rendezvous programs which Flight Crew felt to be mandatory to
substantially improve their operational procedures. In order to
complete this program definition phase as quickly as possible,
a team of MSC and MIT people spent the week of October 2 at MIT formulating
and documenting all unresolved items in GSOP Chapter 4 format.
I think this was accomplished very well in terms of both quality
and speed resulting in a rough draft of the GSOP with MSC approval upon
which MIT may prepare the final: GSOP and actually begin program
design and coding immediately.

6. Thus, all three programs, SUNDANCE, LUMINARY, and COLOSSUS are
now, in effect, covered by approved GSOP's and are under configuration
control. That is, any changes must be handled through the
standard change control procedures.

7. Unfortunately, it is highly probable that a similar exercise
will eventually be necessary involving the Descent and possibly
the Ascent portions of LUMINARY program once experience is obtained
in their operation on the simulators at MIT and MSC. Mandatory
changes to simplify crew procedures are likely to arise and the
importance of crew evaluation of these processors at the earliest
time can not be over emphasized. Whatever can be done by the
Flight Crew Operations Directorate to provide a meaningful evaluation
facility and to utilize it for this purpose should be done for
everybody's benefit.
