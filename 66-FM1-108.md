This memorandum is to give my impression of what went on during the
meeting at MIT on September 12, 1966, regarding the AS-501/502 spacecraft
guidance computer program. Primarily I would like to describe
the status of this program as we see it now.

We had previously been aiming for a release of the flight program for
rope manufacture on October 10. However, Dan Likely (MIT), who has
recently taken over management of this program, informed us that the
recent intense activity on the AS-204 program had completely saturated
the 1800 computers they all use for program development. As a result,
they had not been able to make a single computer run on the AS-501
program for a period of about two weeks. This had seriously disrupted
their planned program development and it was Dan's recommendation that
we delay release of this program until October 24, if at all possible.
Assuming adequate availability of the computers, Dan expects to finish
verification runs by October 1O and wishes to utilize the extra two
weeks for evaluating these tests to assure himself of flight readiness
prior to its release. Aaron Cohen checked with his associates who are
affected by this schedule and was able to negotiate this delay, which
we all felt to be highly desirable in order to avoid a repetition of the
AS-204 situation. In that case, you recall, we were forced to release
the program before some of the verification tests had even been run and
before the test results had been examined. It is probably worth noting
that Dan Likely appears to be taking over quickly and doing a very good
job. At least 1 certainly feel a great deal of confidence in his
ability to do this job right and on schedule. We intend to schedule a
Software Panel final status review on October 18, to be followed by a
presentation to all interested MSC personnel a week or so later.

AC Electronics was represented'at this meeting and reported that nine
of their people are now temporary residents at MIT, working exclusively
on the AS-501/502 AGC mission programming effort. In fact, they
constitute almost the entire work force at Likely's disposal. It is
m n y impression that they have come onboard and have become effective
very quickly. Part of their effort involves development of a simulation
of the Saturn V, which. is required. for program checkout. (Likely
identified this as one of the major remaining problem ares.)

AC also has a 21-man effort operating in Milwaukee. These people are
developing an independent verification facility for Block I programs
which they hope to have operational about September 19. This includes
an "automatic checkout system" capability which among other things is
supposed to reconstruct the actual. program symbolically, thus allowing
rapid and easy examination of the equations which have actually been
programmed into the system. Considering all of the programming effort,
both coding and verification, ahead' of us at MIT over the next several
months, it seems essential to me that we make maximum use of this AC
facility. 1 mean we must not use it in parallel with MIT's, but instead
of MIT's, wherever possible. MIT has been directed to provide detailed
test plans showing how these facilities will be used.

Most of the meeting was devoted to discussion of changes to the AS-202
program for AS-501 and selection of values for some of the flight parameters.
With a few minor exceptions, this all seems to be progressing very nicely.

We finally verified, to the limit of our ability, that the AS-501 program
may be used without change for AS-502. MIT was requested to list
possible problem areas, if any were recognized, particularly associated
with fixed memory constants. Carl Huss was to call an MSC meeting to
re-examine this subject from a trajectory standpoint on September 15.
('This has been done and as of today, we know of no reason these programs cannot be identical. )

That's about it for the AS-501 meeting. On Tuesday we discussed the
Program Development Plans for AS-503 and AS-504 which I will report in
another memorandum -- if I have the nerve.
