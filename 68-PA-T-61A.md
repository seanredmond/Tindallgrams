1. The "D" Rendezvous Mission Techniques meeting of March 10 was probably
one of the least productive so far, and I sincerely apologize for it.  I
must have been tired or something.  Even so, with all that talent present,
there must be something worthwhile reporting.


2. At one of our earlier meetings we tentatively established that platform
alignments would be performed by both vehicles during each period of darkness
throughout the rendezvous exercise.  Paul Pixley (MPAD) presented some data
at this meeting which showed that, from a rendezvous navigation standpoint,
loss of observational data---rendezvous radar in the LM and sextant in the
CSM---during platform alignment hurts us more than a little platform drift.
Accordingly, it is their proposal that platform alignments onle be performed
prior to the separation burn which initiates the football rendezvous in the
beginning and in the darkness period shared by the psuedo-TPI when the LM
is above the command module.  This applies to both the LM and CSM. Unless
someone has reason for disagreeing with this, their recommendation is accepted
and all further work should be based upon it.


3.  In response to an action item from the very first meeting, the 0rbital
Mission Analysis Branch (formerly the Rendezvous Analysis Branch) reported
their progress on developing techniques for insuring proper station coverage
and lighting conditions during the rendezvous exercise in spite of trajectory
perturbations earlier in the mission.  The most significant of these
perturbations, of course, is failure to launch on time.  As a result of
their work, it is anticipated they will recommend selection of an earlier
nominal launch time and change in direction of the SPS engine tests early
in the mission so that the spacecraft will nominally fly in a higher orbit,
during the period between them.  In addition, it will probably be recommended
that these big SPS burns be separated in time by approximately a day instead
of occurring within the same period of activity.  If these things are done
it will be possible to compensate for lift off time delays by decreasing the
horizontal, in-plane component of these SPS burns in real time such that the
spacecraft does not go to such a high altitude, thereby shortening the
orbital period during that period.  The implementation to carry out targetting
of these maneuvers in real time may utilize the rendezvous mission planning
tools in the RTCC that are already available.  Their proposed approach would
be to modify the SPS burns using the Gemini Agena maneuver logic to cause
the spacecraft to rendezvous with a phantom target.  The phantom target
being where the spacecraft would have been if it had been launched on
time and followed the nominal maneuver sequence. If this technique
proves to be as resonable as it seems to be now, changes to the nominal
mission plan noted above will be processed through the FOP by Morrin
Jenkins.

4. I just reread that last paragraph and it sounds like I'm still asleep.
Does it make sense to you?
