I thought it might be fun to have an overall AAP CSM Computer Program
Requirements meeting so we've scheduled one on Wednesday, January 28, 1970 at 9
a.m. in Room 966 of Building 2. At this time we would like to reach agreement
upon a list of deletions which can be made to a particular mainline Apollo
Colossus program established as the baseline. We would then like to identify all
additions and/or modifications required to support AAP. This definition should
be in the form of functional requirements although it should be advantageous to
carry their definition to a fairly fine degree of detail when possible to do so.
We are also anxious to understand just what these programs are going to be used
for.

Based on the results of this meeting, the Flight Support Division of FOD will
generate the formal requirements documentation to be forwarded to MIT for
implementation and the program will be placed under configuration control as
soon as possible - over two years before the flight!
