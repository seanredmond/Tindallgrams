1.  We had another "C" Mission Rendezvous Mission Techniques meeting
on February 23.  We resolved a few things and reworked the flow charts
some more at this meeting.

2.  The first item discussed was a carryover from a previous meeting
dealing with how the primary guidance system aligns the SPS engine
prior to each SPS maneuver.  As you know, engine gimbal trim angles
are stored in the DAP data load which are used to align the engine
prior to ignition.  Initial values will probably be loaded prior to
launch to align the thrust vector through the best estimate of spacecraft
cg position for the first SPS burn.  The current 1 sigma estimate
is that these values should be within 0.4° in pitch and yaw.  Of course,
as the engine operates it is possible for the computer to determine
better values to trim the engine thrust through the cg based on actual
performance, and the program can automatically store these updated
engine gimbal trim angles in the DAP data load for use on the next
maneuver.  However, it has been found it will only do this if the
maneuver is greater than about 13.5 seconds in duration.  During the
"C" Mission rendezvous exercise none of the three SPS burns are as
long as 13.5 seconds, and so the PNGCS will not automatically update
these critical parameters.  The original values remain in memory to
be used again on each subsequent maneuver.

3.  As has been previously reported, it is unnecessary to trim delta V
residuals resulting from attitude excursions on the first maneuver, and
so misalignment on that burn is not too critical.  However, they must
be trimmed on the second and third maneuvers of the rendezvous exercise
(see next paragraph) and so failure to update gimbal trim angles would
result in excessive RCS costs.  Therefore, the flight controllers are
establishing a new standard operational procedure whereby they will
ascertain from telemery optimum trim angles during the first burn
to be relayed to the crew for input into the DAP data load prior to
the following burns.

4.  Ed Lineberry and his rendezvous analysis crew presented data to
show the great sensitivity of Terminal Phase Initiation (TPI) time
and burn attitude due to dispersions in the second and third SPS
maneuver---NCC and NSR.  It was agreed that all residules on these
maneuvers must be trimmed out since not to do so would jeopardize the
rendezvous exercise and would probably result in excessive RCS costs
during a terminal phase by not having established optimum initial
conditions for it.  For example, a 1 fps horizontal, in plane residual
on either NCC₂ or NSR produces a 4 minute shift in TPI time.

5.  Milt Contella (FCSD) presented the results of their study to
determine optimum lighting conditions for the terminal phase.  This
work is being completely documented.  The points of particular interest
to us, however, are that they have established that the ground targeted
maneuvers should be determined to cause TPI to occur at local sunset
plus 7 minutes to within ± 10 minutes.  It was interesting to note that
the lighting constraints are primarily associated with the braking
maneuver, whereas on Gemini consideration was also given to the lighting
conditions at TPI itself.  Specifically, they wanted to assure that the
spacecraft breaks into daylight no later than the time at which they
have approached to within one mile of each other, and preferably 3 or 4
miles.  They also want to assure at least 10 minutes in daylight
following the impulsive braking time (TPF).

6.  Review of the flow charts caused us to reverse a decision reported
in the last meeting minutes.  Namely, it was stated that if it were
determined the PNCGS had failed just prior to the first SPS burn, we
would continue on with the rendezvous exercise using SCS for that
maneuver.  Based on the data presented by the Orbital Rendezvous Analysis
people showing the extreme sensitivity of the terminal phase conditions
to small dispersions in the SPS burns, it is evident that the rendezvous
is almost certain to fail without PNGCS.  Rather than embark on an
exercise under those conditions, we concluded the best course of action
was to delay it to the next day and do it then if the PNCGS can be made
to work in the interim.  The S-IVB battery lifetime will have been
exhausted by then, but with the relatively short ranges involved it is
still possible the sextant will be able to provide adequate observations
without the S-IVB light.  Without PNGCS we might as well quit since
we are almost assured of exceeding the RCS redline which would force
abandonment of the rendezvous before completion anyway.

7.  I contacted Neil Townsend (PPD) and confirmed that making the
three SPS burns now planned within one revolution does not violate any
SPS systems constraints.  He is preparing a memo in support of this,
and I report with appreciation that the Systems Engineering Division
(Dutch von Ehrenfried) has also sent me a note okaying it.  I also
asked about the importance of the fuel slosh test that they have
included in the timeline following the first SPS burn.  This requires
maintaining a period of no attitude control for a considerable peroid
of time which conflicts with our desire to immediately initiate sextant
observations of the S-IVB for rendezvous navigation.  Townsend readily
agreed that the fuel slosh test could be performed on a later maneuver
in the mission and, thus, there was no need to trade off one of these
activities against the other.

8.  It was noted that the Flight Crew people are considering adding a
second midcourse correction in the terminal phase at 12 minutes after
TPI. in addition to the current one 20 minutes after TPI.  We'll hear
more about that at the next meeting which will be at 9:00 a.m. on
Friday, March 1, 1968.  We'll probably start in the middle of the data
flows this time to see if we can get to the end just once.  Maybe
there's something interesting in that part of it!
