</header>

<p>Jim, this is just a reminder of conversations with you and Emil about
a job I'd like your people to do. In th£nking more about this orbit
determination task wherein the LEM determines the CSM orbit while sitting
on the lunar surface, I wonder if perhaps MIT has lost sight of our primary 
objectives, thus leading them to the conclusion that they should use
only range and range rate data.</p>

<p>The only purpose of this orbit determination, as you recall, is to determine 
the <span class="ul">orientation of the CSM's orbital plane</span> for use in targeting the
LEM ascent guidance and to <span class="ul">select a lift-off time</span> which must be within a
few seconds of optimum. It is not to obtain some sort of a precision
total state vector of the CSM. Based on these ground rules, I just can't
believe that the angular radar data, even with relatively large biases,
cannot be useful if properly weighted, and I would think that it would
provide a great strength or reliability to the process, which I would
consider mandatory. That is, we are much more interested in assuring
ourselves of getting a pretty good answer all the time rather than an
excellent answer some of the time.</p>

<p>The questions to be answered are: should we or shouldn't we use the angular 
data, even with large biases, and how do we take maximum advantage
of our external knowledge, such as the CSM's own orbit determination
(though it's <span class="ul">not</span> with respect to the LEM). Don't forget, this data
processing must be <span class="ul">entirely</span> automatic. The crew will never have time
to learn how to operate all those statistical filters, etc., whatever
they are.</p>

<p>Emil said he would start something here, but I wanted to make sure you
were aware of it and concurred and, in particular, would give it some
of your own personal attention. Perhaps these remarks belong at the top,
but I'd just like to reiterate that as much as I distrust it, I'm afraid
our best source of relative orbit determination for this particular mission 
phase may be by the <span class="ul">LEM</span> radar data. I doubt if the CSM will ever
see the LEM on the surface, at least we'd better not count on it, and the
MSFN tracking certainly can't figure out where the LEM is. Our other
source is the G&amp;N state vector T/M at LEM touchdown, which is probably ·
the best, if the antenna are pointed at us.</p>
