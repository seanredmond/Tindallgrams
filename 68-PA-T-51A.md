1.  As you know, a great deal of work had been done on lunar abort
rendezvous throughout the Center.  This note is to inform you of a
Data Priority Coordination meeting on this subject on March 28, 1968,
in Building 3, Room 966.  I expect it will take most of the day.

2.  What we are interested in determining is what are the ground and
crew procedures based on the current rendezvous abort plan.  The first
part of the meeting will be devoted to a review of abort plans from
any part of the descent trajectory, both coasting and powered flight,
and from the lunar surface.  Of course, it involves LM active, and
command module active and in some cases both vehicles active.  We
are particularly interested in establishing those procedures associated
with lunar abort rendezvous which must be included in the nominal timeline.
For example, targeting of the CSM to perform LM rescue maneuvers
prior to the abort situation and targeting of the LM on the lunar
surface for lift off on a CSM revolution earlier than planned.
