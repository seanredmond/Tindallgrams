subject: Apollo Spacecraft Software Configuration Control Board notes for March 4 meeting

 1.  Close to half the meeting was devoted to discussion of the Delta V
monitor.  It was reported that the propulsion people have conferred in
writing that the Delta V monitor program should not shut off the SPS
engine on the Spacecraft 020 and 101 missions.  It was also reported
that MIT is still working on the basic Delta V mode design for Colossus,
the primary goal being to maintain the PNGCS in a workable state.
Tom Price was given the task of organizing the work from MSC's viewpoint
and coordinating it with MIT in detail.  In the LM programs there are
apparently serious implications regarding ullage arising from the 15
second limit for the RCS jets impurging on the DPS.  It is still not clear
what will be done about that.


 2.  In response to a previous action item (10.1.4) G&C reported that
ullage as commanded by the AGS is DEDA accessible, that is, the crew
can change its duration if that is necessary.

 3.  I withdrew our PCS No. 33 dealing with the lunar surface navigation
program in Luminary.  This PCR was to obtain radar data on the downlink
at a higher frequency than is currently programmed.  It became clear
that there were a number of unresolved questions dealing with how we
want to use both this program and the Ascent program (P-12), which should
be resolved before we finalize our PCR description.  We were told that we
may delay this PCR for another month with no additional program delivery
impact and we have some analyses and meetings scheduled which should
illuminate the subject considerably.

 4.  PCR No. 50 deals with changes in Colossus preentry computations and
displays (P-61 and P-62).  After considerable discussion, MIT was
directed to remove the processors in Colossus which provide an automatic
maneuver to the command module/service module separation attitude.  The
other part of the PCR requesting prediction of gimbal angles at 0.05 g's
would cost 4 days schedule impact and, since Tom Stafford agreed it was
not mandatory, this part of the change was not approved.

 5.  PCR No. 57 was not discussed at this meeting.

 6.  PCR No. 63, to delete command module steering of the S-IVB during the
TLI maneuver, was finally approved.

 7.  PCR No. 70, which ass the jerk term to the Descent Abort programs
(P-70 and P-71), was not discussed at this meeting since MIT has not
completed their detailed evaluation yet.  It is supposed to be ready
for the next meeting.

 8.  PCR No. 72,, a LM DAP change to Sundance dealing with attitude rate
limits, was disapproved.

 9.  PCR No. 80 was an MIT initiated change to provide state vector
synchronization with no schedule impact for Colossus, Luminary and
Sundance.  It was approved.

10.  PCR No. 81 dealt with a change MIT made in the Auge-Kugel coefficients
in Colossus.  This was done without MSC concurrance and this approved PCR
directed MIT to return to the Sundisk values.

11.  PCR's 83 and 85 both dealth with x-axis override in Sundance and
Luminary.  It was agrees that PCR No. 85 as prepared by MIT was the better,
so it was approved; and PCR No. 83 was disapproved.

12.  PCR No. 88 provides the capability of changing range variances, whatever
they are, in Colossus and Luminary cased on more up-to-date analyses and
actual flight experience by putting both of them in erasable.  This change
was approved for Colossus and Luminary with no schedule impact.  A visibility
impact on Sundance was requested.

13.  PCR Nos. 90 and 91 deal with downlink changes to Sundance requested
by FCD, both of which were approved.

14.  PCR No. 92, to add a valid date indicater to the Colossus landmark
tracking downlink data, was postponed  until the next meeting.

15.  PCR No. 94 requested a change in the Colossus entry guidance logic
such that it will work for reduced L/D vehicles.  It was approved.

16.  PCR No. 95 which changes the DSKY display polarity for the rendezvous
radar trunion angle in Sundance to be consistent with standard pilot
sign convention was approved.

17.  PCR No. 96, which provides the capability in Sundance of moving the
rendezvous radar gyro package out of the view of the AOT was approved with
a one day impact.

18.  PCR No. 97 removes a program alarm in Sundance associated with the
rendezvous radar which was certain to occur during perfectly nominal LM
rendezvous operations.  It was approved.

19.  PCR No. 98 provides a capability of moving the rendezvous radar
antenna out of the field of view of the AOT while the rendezvous navigation
program is in operation.  Discussion of this change was delayed until the
next meeting.

20.  PCR No. 99 deals with making the DSKY display of shaft and trunion
angles of the rendezvous radar in Mode II more meaningful to the crew.
It was disapproved for Sundance and will be discussed for Luminary the
next time.

21.  PCR No. 103 authorizes MIT to do no level 5 testing of the Sundance
programs which provide rendezvous maneuver targeting to the CSM, since
the P-70 series will not be used on the "D" and "E" missions.  This was
approved.

22.  PCR No. 104 would have deleted the requirement for the P-21 program
in Sundance.  It provides a display of latitude, longitude and height.
When it was understood how the crew intends to use it, the PCR was
disapproved.

23.  Three changes dealing with the throttling of the DPS in the Luminary
program were requested by MPAD and are to be discussed at the next meeting.

24.  This memorandum is to give a very brief rundown of what happened at
this meeting.  It is obvious from the great number of items under discussion
that if you are interested in any specific one in detail, you will have to
check in person with someone that was there, or await distribution of the
formal minutes of the meeting.
